VEBLEN is a language *heavily* under construction. If you've been redirected here, I would have probably asked you to provide commentary on the progress.

So far it is pretty easy to do so --- there aren't many *stuff* here yet! Just a bunch of **formal declarations** --- as in, imperative C structures.

[VEBLEN.ebnf](VEBLEN.ebnf) would be containing the grammar specs in EBNF notation. 

[Inter.h](Inter.h) includes Peyton Jones' *enriched* Lambda calculus declarations (see: University of London College, 1987).

[Ord.h](Ord.h) would include S-Expressions (note: It's for **ordinary** Lambda calc, VEBLEN itself is not LISP-like!)

[Token.h](Token.h) contains token info.


Please have a look-see and let me know what you think so far?
